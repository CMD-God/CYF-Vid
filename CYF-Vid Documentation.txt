Video Objects

LuaVideoController video = CreateVideoPlayer(string file_name, boolean infront = true)
	Creates a Video Object, which plays the video file_name in the Assets/Resources/Videos folder.
	If infront is false, the camera will play behind everything, even under the background, otherwise it will play above everything else (even the debugger).
	Videos player are always full-screen.

bool video.isinfront
	If video.infront is false, the camera will play behind everything, even under the background, otherwise it will play above everything else (even the debugger).

bool video.isprepared
	Wether the video is plrepared or not.

bool video.isactive
	Is the video active or not? Recommended to check this before doing any action with a video object that might not exist!

bool video.playonawake
	Should the video play as soon as it can? 
	False by default.
	This is the equivalent of initializing a video player and calling it's video.Play() function right away.

float video.alpha
	How transparent is the video? 1.0 is fully visible, while 0.0 is completely invisible.
	Maximum: 1. Minimum: 0.

long video.currentframe
	The frame the video is currently on. (Kinda like seconds)

bool video.islooping
	Should the video play again every time it ends or not?

float video.speed
	How fast should the playback be? 1.0 is normaal speed, 2.0 is twice as fast, 0.5 is half as fast.
	Maximum: 3. Minimum: -3.

string video.aspectratio
	How should the video be stretched on the screen?
	Valid values:
		"NoScaling"
        	"FitVertically"
        	"FitHorizontally"
        	"FitInside"
        	"FitOutside"
        	"Stretch"

void video.Play()
	Plays/Unpauses the video.

void video.Pause()
	Pauses video playback.

void video.Prepare()
	Pre-loads the video. Recommended to run before you decide to play the video. This is automatically done before playing a video if you didn't do it beforehand, causing a delay between calling video.Play() and the video actually playing!

void video.Remove()
	Removes the video player.



Misc. Object Additions

float Misc.screenrotation
	Specifies the rotation of the camera. The camera always rotates around the centre of the screen by default.

void Misc.RotateScreenAdvanced(float x, float y, float z)
	Rotates the camera around in 3D space.
	! Causes weird visuals. Use with caution !
	Normal rotation is the z angle.

void Misc.ScaleScreen(float x_scale, float y_scale)
	Scales the screen around it's centre point. Good for confusing battles.

void Misc.ResetCamera()
	Now it resets all kinds of rotation and scaling in addition to movement.
